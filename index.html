    <p>My name is Joe Barbone. I've been in the IT industry for over 30 years. The first seven years were spent as a software developer, and I loved it. That is my main reason for me taking this course, I want to get back into development, and what better place to do it than on the web!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I like to run, mt bike, hike, ride motorcycles and almost anything else outdoors.</p>
